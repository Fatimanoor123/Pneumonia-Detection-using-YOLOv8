# Pneumonia Detection using YOLOv8

This project demonstrates **Pneumonia Detection from chest X-ray images** using a YOLOv8 model. The goal is to classify X-ray images as **Normal** or **Pneumonia** using object detection techniques.  

> **Note:** This project is for learning purposes only and is **not intended for medical diagnosis**.

## Project Overview

- Trained a **YOLOv8 model** to detect Pneumonia in chest X-ray images.  
- Classifies images as either **Normal** or **Pneumonia**.  
- Demonstrates the full workflow from **dataset preparation â†’ model training â†’ inference**.

---

## Dataset

- Model trained on a **publicly available Pneumonia dataset**, such as the **Kaggle Chest X-ray dataset**: [https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)  
- Dataset contains X-ray images divided into `train`, `val`, and `test` folders, with subfolders for `NORMAL` and `PNEUMONIA`.

**Tip:** For GitHub, include only a few sample images in `sample_images/` for demonstration.

## YOLOv8 Training

1. Set up **Google Colab** with GPU runtime.  
2. Install ultralytics YOLOv8:

```bash
!pip install ultralytics
```

3. Prepare dataset folder structure:

```
dataset/
â”œâ”€â”€ train/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ NORMAL/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PNEUMONIA/
â”œâ”€â”€ val/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ NORMAL/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PNEUMONIA/
```

4. Train the YOLOv8 model:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load pretrained YOLOv8n model
model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")  

# Train the model
model.train(
    data="path/to/data.yaml",  # dataset YAML file
    epochs=50,
    imgsz=224,
    batch=16,
    project="runs/train",
    name="pneumonia_detection"
)
```

- `best.pt` will be saved in:

```
runs/train/pneumonia_detection/weights/best.pt
```

---

## Inference / Testing

After training, run inference on new X-ray images:

```bash
python inference.py
```

- The script can process **single images** or **all images in a folder**.  
- Output images with predictions are saved in `runs/classify/`.  

---

## Folder Structure for GitHub

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd Pneumonia-Detection-YOLOv8
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run inference:
